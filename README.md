# Election-Audit Summary
From the data obtained we know the count and percentage each county contributed to the election.  What is not included in this code is the specific candidate vote totals by county.  This would provide a more in-depth review of which candidates were voted for in each county. This information could help ascertain the popularity of a candidate in a specific county.  We could also modify the county to state to expand our analysis and possibly use it for, dare I say it, the Presidential Election.
